BUILDING INTERACTIVE JAVASCRIPT WEBSITES

Your mission is to construct a single-page website that plays a fully-functional game. You will see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact harmoniously to produce a dynamic website.


Believe it or not, you have the capabilities of building every feature in this game - from the layout to the logic. Be patient, take creative risks, and most importantly, have fun!
